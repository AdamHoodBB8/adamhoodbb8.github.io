        <h4 id="bongles">Bongles</h4>
        <p>This was a 3D point and click adventure game I created in a small team. I was originally in charge of Puzzle and Level Design but slowly transitioned into also working with the programming team to create the movement system and code the interactions and inventory systems.
          I was also responsible for importing art created for the game, aswell as importing animations.
        </p>
        <p>This was a really great experience as the team worked well together, and we ended up creating something I'm proud of.

        <h4 id="honsProj">Honours Project</h4>
        <p>For my University Honours Project, I was looking at player type classifications (Bartle mainly) and how they correlate with that players choices in a narrative based game.</p>
        <p>This is the short game I created that was used as part of the study. It's quite a simple game but helped me gather data in the testing phase.</p>

        <h4 id="ringcon">Ringcon Experiment</h4>
        <p>In an Experimenal Games module at University, I messed around with using the Ringfit Adventure Ringcon as an input device for different games. This allowed me to create some weird gameplay experiences using simple prototypes. I am still currently working on a project using this controller.</p>
